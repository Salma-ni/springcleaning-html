## The User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```
## Description and Acceptance Criteria 
This repo is for Challange 1 of the course - making a HTML accessible with CSS. 
I found this challange a little confusing at first because initially I thought we were given a starter code that was jumbled up and our aim was to make it look like the screenshot of the html provided... so that's what i started to do, I re-wrote the entire thing to make sure all the sections were in the correct place but something wasn't adding up after 6 hours work... only to find out that the original index html already had everything in place, my job was just to alter it, not recreate it! So I started from scratch again to fit the acceptance criteria . 
* I used semantic html elemants like nav, section, article
* I believe the html elements follow a logical structure
* I used 'alt' for images to make it more accessible
* Made sure the headings were numbered in order
* Ensured the title said Horiseon
* Add comments to the html and CSS that is usually used for the developers

Additionally, I tried to frequently save the work by git add, commit and pushing back to GitHub.

There are some things I'm still struggling with, such as grasping CSS ordering but I'm not far away, I can see the end goal in sight.
